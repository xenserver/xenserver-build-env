# xcp-ng-build-env

This docker config and collection of supporting scripts allows for creating
a docker container to work on and build a XCP-ng package from an SRPM or from
a directory containing a `SOURCES/` and a `SPECS/` directory along with appropriate
RPM spec file and software sources.
It will build a Docker container with the right build environment (including some
useful tools).
Depending on the parameters, it will either do everything automatically to build a
given package, or just install build-dependencies and let you work manually from a shell
in the container context. Or even just start the container and let you do anything you
want.

## Configuration

You'll need to install docker. Follow the instructions for your platform on
https://www.docker.com/

## Building

You need one docker image per target version of XCP-ng.

```
Usage: ./build.sh {version_of_XCP_ng}
... where {version_of_XCP_ng} is either dev, latest (for latest stable release), or a 'x.y' version such as 7.5.
```

## Using the container

Use the `run.py` script. It accepts a variety of parameters allowing for different uses:
* rebuild an existing source RPM (with automated installation of the build dependencies)
* build a package from an already extracted source RPM (sources and spec file), or from a directory that follows the rpmbuild convention (a `SOURCES/` directory and a `SPECS/` directory). Most useful for building packages from XCP-ng's git repositories of RPM sources: https://github.com/xcp-ng-rpms.
* or simply start a shell in the build environment, with the appropriate CentOS, EPEL et XCP-ng yum repositories enabled.

```sh
usage: run.py [-h] [-b BRANCH] [-l BUILD_LOCAL] [--define DEFINE]
              [-r REBUILD_SRPM] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-n] [-p PACKAGE] [-s SRPM]
              [-d DIR] [-e ENV] [-v VOLUME] [--rm] [--syslog] [--name NAME]
              ...

positional arguments:
  command               Command to run inside the prepared container

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b BRANCH, --branch BRANCH
                        XCP-ng version: 7.5, dev, etc. If not set, will
                        default to dev.
  -l BUILD_LOCAL, --build-local BUILD_LOCAL
                        Install dependencies for the spec file(s) found in the
                        SPECS/ subdirectory of the directory passed as
                        parameter, then build the RPM(s). Built RPMs and SRPMs
                        will be in RPMS/ and SRPMS/ subdirectories. Any
                        preexisting BUILD, BUILDROOT, RPMS or SRPMS
                        directories will be removed first. If --output-dir is
                        set, the RPMS and SRPMS directories will be copied to
                        it after the build.
  --define DEFINE       Definitions to be passed to rpmbuild (if --build-local
                        or --rebuild-srpm are passed too). Example: --define
                        'xcp_ng_section extras', for building the 'extras'
                        version of a package which exists in both 'base' and
                        'extras' versions.
  -r REBUILD_SRPM, --rebuild-srpm REBUILD_SRPM
                        Install dependencies for the SRPM passed as parameter,
                        then build it. Requires the --output-dir parameter to
                        be set.
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Output directory for --rebuild-srpm and --build-local.
  -n, --no-exit         After executing either an automated build or a custom
                        command passed as parameter, drop user into a shell
  -p PACKAGE, --package PACKAGE
                        Packages for which dependencies will be installed
  -s SRPM, --srpm SRPM  SRPMs for which dependencies will be installed
  -d DIR, --dir DIR     Local dir to mount in the image. Will be mounted at
                        /external/<dirname>
  -e ENV, --env ENV     Environment variables passed directly to docker -e
  -v VOLUME, --volume VOLUME
                        Volume mounts passed directly to docker -v
  --rm                  Destroy the container on exit
  --syslog              Enable syslog to host by mounting in /dev/log
  --name NAME           Assign a name to the container
```

**Examples**

Rebuild an existing source RPM (with automated installation of the build dependencies)
```sh
./run.py -b dev --rebuild-srpm /path/to/some-source-rpm.src.rpm --output-dir /path/to/output/directory --rm
```

Build from git (and put the result into RPMS/ and SRPMS/ subdirectories)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/xcp-ng-rpms/xapi.git

# ... here add your patches ...

/path/to/run.py -b dev --buildlocal xapi --rm
```

**Important switches**

* `-b` / `--branch` allows to select which version of XCP-ng to work on (defaults to `dev` if not specified).
* `--no-exit` drops you to a shell after the build, instead of closing the container. Useful if the build fails and you need to debug.
* `--rm` destroys the container on exit. Helps preventing docker from using too much space on disk. You can still reclaim space afterwards by running `docker container prune` and `docker image prune`
* `-v` / `--volume` (see *Mounting repos from outside the container* below)


## Building packages manually

If you need to build packages manually, here are some useful commands

Install the dependencies of the package using yum:

```sh
yum-builddep xapi
```

then either download the SRPM using yumdownloader:

```sh
yumdownloader --source xapi
rpmbuild --rebuild xapi*
```

or clone the source from a git repository:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api
cd xen-api
./configure
make
```

## Mounting repos from outside the container
If you'd like to develop using the tools on your host and preseve the changes
to source and revision control but still use the container for building, you
can do using by using a docker volume.

Once you have built your image you can run it with an extra argument to mount
a directory from your host to a suitable point inside the container. For
example, if I clone some repos into a directory on my host, say `/work/code/`,
then I can mount it inside the container as follows:

```sh
docker run -i -t -v /work/code:/mnt/repos -u $(id -u) <IMAGE> /bin/bash
```

The `-u` flag uses the right UID inside so that changes made in the container
are with the same UID as outside the container. Docker >=1.6 supports group IDs
as well and both the group and user can be referenced by name.

Then the following format is available to set the UID/GID:

```sh
-u, --user=                Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
```
